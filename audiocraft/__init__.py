AudioCraft is a general framework for training audio generative models.
At the moment we provide the training code for:

- [MusicGen](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05284), a state-of-the-art
    text-to-music and melody+text autoregressive generative model.
    For the solver, see `audiocraft.solvers.musicgen.MusicGenSolver`, and for the model,
    `audiocraft.models.musicgen.MusicGen`.
- [AudioGen](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15352), a state-of-the-art
    text-to-general-audio generative model.
- [EnCodec](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13438), efficient and high fidelity
    neural audio codec which provides an excellent tokenizer for autoregressive language models.
    See `audiocraft.solvers.compression.CompressionSolver`, and `audiocraft.models.encodec.EncodecModel`.
- [MultiBandDiffusion](TODO), alternative diffusion-based decoder compatible with EnCodec that
    improves the perceived quality and reduces the artifacts coming from adversarial decoders.
